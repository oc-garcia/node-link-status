The File interface provides information about files and allows JavaScript to access their content.

They are usually retrieved from a [FileList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList) object that is returned as a result of the user's selection of files through the [<input>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input) element, from the [DataTransfer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) object used in drag and drop operations, or from the `mozGetAsFile()` API on an [HTMLCanvasElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement). In Gecko, privileged codes can create File objects representing any local file without user interaction (see [Implementation notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File#implementation_notes) for more information.).
